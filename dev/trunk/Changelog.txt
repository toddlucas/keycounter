- improved stability
- many bugfixes

0.9.1 2007-01-15
-----------------
new column for hits per minute in FormDisplay->Per Key
Visual Studio AboutBox replaces FormAbout, THX to UNCLE JAMAL for the nice pic!
some new icons for the tray-bar context-menu (looks cool with the new AboutBox :-)
fixed bug B1 "uptime standby" with a regular uptime-update (timer in FormMain)
note: the slow timer period causes the uptime to increase in steps of 10s; anyhow, the
internal counter precision is not reduced.
basic support for GPLv2

0.9.0 2007-01-08
-----------------
setting "debugModeEnabled" switched to false -> no debug-windows for users
Fixed summary-tab of FormDisplay ("Average key hits per minute since last reset")
FormAbout shows compilation-date and -time (helper program CompileInfo.exe)
